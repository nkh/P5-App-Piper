for fixed formats a simpler definition than regexes

move color_pipe and both version of piper here and  in git

need a complex, but easy to use, way to describe what the regex match

debug modes
	display regex and color definitions
	dispay generated regex
	display matches
		with and without colot
		what regex matched, as it looked on the command line

accept ansi123 as a valid color even if Term:.ANSIColor does not

colors changing for lines
	a regex has a color at a specif line, another at another line
		can be done with two regexes, simpler clearer, but more verbose

vertical cut
	define range in line, start-length or regex, and the regexs to be applied to it
		this scopes the regexs
	allow perl expression for range 3..7 
	sed -n '3,7p; end +1s'
	make it possible to color in parallel via pipes


	eg:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
		piper v_cut 1 .. 6   regex-color regex-color
		piper

	range can also be created by inserting code in stdin that needs to be matches by 
	subsequent reges
		s/(?<=.{10})/code/
		new regex are is: (r1|r2|r3).*code



color from LS_COLOR

aliases
	for regex, color, or regex-color

fix bug in example file in this directory

add tests to distro

regex mode
	free, regexes are reused
	sequential r2 matches only if r1 matches, ..
	number of time a regex can be used in the line
		1:regex, can only color once
	multi color per regex, aka normal perl regext
		/r1 .. r2 .. r3/ c1,c2,c3
